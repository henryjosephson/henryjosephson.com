Asking questions is important. Though I'm framing these as questions I mostly ask others (especially when I'm getting interviews or trying to get to know them better), they're also great questions to ask yourself. Notice what you aren't noticing.
 - What's your mission?
 - If you woke up tomorrow and The Mission got solved, what would you do with your life?
 - [If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)
   - What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now?
 - If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favor of breaking up with them?
 - Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t?
 - How do you approach difficult choices?
 - What are you avoiding?
 - What mistake do you think I'm most likely to make?
 - What do you think I'm probably missing?
 - If I gave you a magic wand that you could use to change one thing about {your field}, what do you change?
 - If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?
