Asking questions is important. Though I'm framing these as questions I mostly ask others,[^1] they're also great questions to ask yourself. Notice what you aren't noticing.

## Quesions you can maybe ask in an interview
 - What's your mission?
   - If you woke up tomorrow and The Mission got solved, what would you do with your life?
 - What would you do if you couldn't fail?
 - [If you had to leave your job today, what would you do instead?](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)
   - What would you do if you weren't allowed to work?
   - What’s the best argument in favor of doing that right now?
 - If I gave you a magic wand that you could use to change one thing about {your field}, what do you change?
 - What's the most important unsolved problem in your field?
 - Have you read anything good lately?

## Questions you probably shouldn't ask in an interview, but which are still good questions
 - What do you most want to improve about yourself?
   - What are you going to do to improve it?
 - What are three things you do for fun that *aren't consumption*?[^2]
 - Imagine someone who knows you deeply — what would be the most personally-hurtful way they could fill the blank: "I don't think you're ___"?
   - What're you doing to make sure you aren't / don't come off as ___?
 - If you have a partner, what’s the best argument in favor of breaking up with them?
 - Are there ways you behave that you wish you didn’t?
 - How do you approach difficult choices?
 - What are you avoiding?
 - What's your biggest secret?
 - What mistake do you think you're most likely to make?
 - What would you be least surprised to learn you'd missed?
