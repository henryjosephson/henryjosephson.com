title: Why I'm Eval-Skeptic

In a job interview last week, I got the classic Peter Thiel question: "what thing do you believe that you think most of your peers would disagree with?"

My answer? That I'm much more eval-skeptic than most of the people I know in the AI policy space. That isn't to say that I think capability evals are bad, but that I think a lot of people think they're going to be more useful for policymaking than they actually will be.

Like all good ideas, of course, this isn't original,[^1] but I think it's a good idea to explain the gaps I see between *what people want evals to be* and *what I think they actually are*.

So what's actually wrong with them? To answer that question, it'd be helpful to set out clearly what would need to be the case for evals to be useful to policymakers. Ideally, policymakers would have to understand:

- the capability being evaluated,
- the results of the evaluation,
- how they should act on the results of the evaluation,
