I’m very [nerd-snipeable](https://xkcd.com/356/). To combat this over the final two weeks of my second-to-last quarter at UChicago, I’ve been stashing every cool thing I want to read in an inbox, with the promise that I’ll read it later.

Well, now that it’s spring break, “later” is “now.” Given that I’m writing this linkpost, though, “later” is actually “previously,” since I’ve now had time to go through some of the backlog and give you some highlights. Seriously, one of my biggest takeaways here has been just how tough it is to pause the firehose and try to resume it later. I haven’t even been able to go through my massive folder of pdfs!

Anyway, there are enough links that I’ve broken them down into five posts, each linked below.

1. [AI Spring Break Links](https://www.henryjosephson.com/writing/AI%20Spring%20Break%20Links.html)
2. [Science Spring Break Links](https://www.henryjosephson.com/writing/Science%20Spring%20Break%20Links.html)
3. [Non-AI Policy Spring Break Links](https://www.henryjosephson.com/writing/Non-AI%20Policy%20Spring%20Break%20Links.html)
4. [Miscellaneous Spring Break Links](https://www.henryjosephson.com/writing/Miscellaneous%20Spring%20Break%20Notes.html)

I’ve been reading some great hard-copy books, too (shoutout *The Power Broker*, *On The Calculation of Volume*, *Unreasonable Hospitality*, and *Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!*). There’s a *Power Broker* blogpost in the works, I promise. At some point, I’ll post my list of books I’m sitting on — it’s a pretty good slice of the sorts of things that interest me, and would be super useful in case any of you ever want to get me a gift or (even better) [recommend others I might like](https://feedback.henryjosephson.com/).
