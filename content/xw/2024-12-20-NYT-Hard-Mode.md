If you thought that the [normal release](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2024/12/20) of my NYT debut was too hard, Christina Iverson made [Easy Mode clues](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/crosswords/easy-mode-clues-for-dec-20.html)! This is a great idea, and I wholeheartedly support making this hobby I love more accessible to anyone who wants to start.

Indeed, I felt like the NYT editors chose to make many of the clues I'd sent in easier. Again, I think this is the right call â€” I'm the type of nerd who makes these for fun, so the difficulty level that'd be fun for me isn't the same as what'd be best for a general audience.

...aaaaand with all that said, I wanted to make a punny, terrible grid that's a level above the NYT Friday. Since the NYT owns the copyright for this grid, I'll happily take it down, if they'd like. Until then, though:
