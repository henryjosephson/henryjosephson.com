Right now, I'm:

- Finishing up my final quarter at UChicago (time flies!)
- Interning for Seb Krier's policy team at Google Deepmind (I'll put it on LinkedIn soon, but you deserve a reward for actually reading my now page)
- Working on AI transparency initiatives in New York and Illinois
- Reading books:
  - [The Power Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker),
  - [Rainbow's end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End_(Vinge_novel)), and
  - [The Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prize:_The_Epic_Quest_for_Oil,_Money,_and_Power)
- Waiting to hear back from job applications and hoping I don't have to send more
- Researching the interaction between compute and algorithmic improvements, and the implications for policymakers
- Making crossword puzzles

This month's spotify playlist is [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0lzl1PHtdoLxw3mWaJnzb3?si=5d369352dd024b52), but you can see the most recent song I've listened to below (might take a sec to load):
