Right now, I'm:

- Finishing up my final quarter at UChicago (time flies!)
- Working on AI advocacy initiatives in New York and Illinois
- Reading [The Power Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker) and [The Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prize:_The_Epic_Quest_for_Oil,_Money,_and_Power)
- Thinking about how to make AI capability useful, legible, and actionable for policymakers
- Waiting to hear back from job applications and hoping I don't have to send more
- Researching the interaction between compute and algorithmic improvements, and the implications for policymakers
- Finishing my philosophy BA thesis (decision theory for deontologists!)
- Getting ready to TA a machine learning course next quarter
- Making crossword puzzles

If I listened to a song on Spotify in the last few minutes, you can see it here (might take a sec to load):
