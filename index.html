    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Henry. I'm finishing up my final year at the University of Chicago, where I study data science and philosophy.<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">I'm also a footnote enthusiast.</span>
      I make <a href="#crosswords">crosswords</a> for the <i>New York Times</i>, and I'm working in emerging technology policy. After I graduate, I'm hoping to land a role in industry, a legislature, or a think tank, though I might end up in grad school. I'll keep you all updated on my progress! If you're interested in a more-substantial resume,
      you can click <a href="./resume.pdf">here</a> or check my LinkedIn in the <a href="#socials">Socials</a> section below.

      <h2 id="whatDo">I. What am I working on right now?</h2>
      Right now (last updated on 2025-02-22), I'm:
      <ul>
        <li>Finishing up my second-to-last quarter at UChicago (time flies!)</li>
        <li>Reading biographies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker">Robert Moses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan:_An_American_Life">George F. Kennan</a></li>
        <li>Thinking about how to make AI capability useful, legible, and actionable for policymakers</li>
        <li>Working on synthetic data and agents at Morningstar</li>
        <li>Doing some vague stuff at a stealth civic tech startup</li>
        <li>Researching the interaction between compute and algorithmic improvements, and the implications for policymakers</li>
        <li>Finishing my philosophy BA thesis (decision theory for deontologists!)</li>
        <li>Applying for jobs (<a href="#socials">let me know</a> if you want to see the google doc with my five-year plan!)</li>
        <li>TAing Computer Science for Data Science (<a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~mwachs/data120-spr22/syllabus.html">old syllabus</a>)
        and Introduction to Bayesian Epistemology (<a href="https://philosophy.uchicago.edu/node/10130">course page</a> — I'm the first undergrad to TA for UChicago's Philosophy department)</li>
        <li>Making crossword puzzles</li>
        <li>Thinking about what to add to this site<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Thoughts include:
            <ul>
              <li>email subscriptions that don't make me pay substack a lot of money</li>
              <li>comments that integrate with my bare-bones html (staticman)?</li>
              <li>a script to convert my markdown drafts into final html-able versions to put here. <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> does most of the work, but there are a few tweaks that'd be nice to automate.</li>
              <li>a way to convert my firefox bookmarks to a nice html list that i can host here. maybe something like <a href="https://home.hedy.dev/bookmarks/?">this</a>?</li>
              <li>a random button on the <a href="./404.html">404 page</a>. easy version would be a random page on this site, harder version would be a random article I've liked.</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="words">II. Writing</h2>
      Here's a quick look through a few public-facing things I've written. I haven't finished consolidating everything here, so feel free to <a href="#socials">reach out</a> and check if you're looking for a particular genre of writing that isn't below, there's a chance I have it anyway.

    <h2 id="feedback">V. Leave me anonymous feedback!</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that I ought to be the best version of myself that I can. I aspire
      to change my mind as I see new evidence, and it's very important to me that
      I balance the knowledge that I could be totally wrong with the push to 
      actually do the things I think are right.<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">
        I draw inspiration here from Joe Carlsmith's excellent piece <a href="https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/on-sincerity"><i>On Sincerity</i></a>.
