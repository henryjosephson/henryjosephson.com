    <p>
      Hi! I'm Henry. I'm finishing up my final year at the University of Chicago, where I study data science and philosophy.<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">I'm also a footnote enthusiast.</span>
      I make <a href="#crosswords">crosswords</a> for the <i>New York Times</i>, and I work in emerging technology policy. After I graduate, I'm hoping to land a role in industry, a legislature, or a think tank. I'll keep you all updated on my progress! If you're interested in a more-substantial resume,
      you can click <a href="./resume.pdf">here</a> or check my LinkedIn in the <a href="#socials">Socials</a> section below.

I haven't finished consolidating everything here, so feel free to <a href="#socials">reach out</a> and check if you're looking for a particular genre of writing that isn't below, there's a chance I have it anyway.

    <h2 id="feedback">V. Leave me anonymous feedback!</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that I ought to be the best version of myself that I can. I aspire
      to change my mind as I see new evidence, and it's very important to me that
      I balance the knowledge that I could be totally wrong with the push to 
      actually do the things I think are right.<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">
        I draw inspiration here from Joe Carlsmith's excellent piece <a href="https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/on-sincerity"><i>On Sincerity</i></a>.
