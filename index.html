    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Henry. I'm finishing up my final year at the University of Chicago, where I study data science and philosophy.<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">I'm also a footnote enthusiast.</span>
      I'm working in emerging technology policy, and am working to land a post-graduation role in industry or a think tank. I'll keep you all updated on my progress! If you're interested in a more-substantial resume,
      you should check my LinkedIn in the <a href="#socials">Socials</a> section below. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If you, like me, want a website that looks like a <span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span>
      document, then you should check out the <a href="https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css">theme I'm using</a>, which was made by Vincent Doerig.

      <h2 id="whatDo">I. What am I working on right now?</h2>
      Right now, I'm:
      <ul>
        <li>Breathing before my second-to-last quarter at UChicago starts in January</li>
        <li>Finishing up the first draft of my philosophy BA thesis</li>
        <li>Working on applications (<a href="#socials">let me know</a> if you want to see the google doc with my five-year plan!)</li>
        <li>Looking for motivated, technical- and policy-minded UChicago students who want to work on AI governance research with me at <a href="https://xrisk.uchicago.edu">XLab</a>. If that sounds like it might be you, you should <a href="https://coda.io/form/W25-XLab-AI-Governance-Working-Group_d-5BZHI8qIa">apply</a> before December 28th.</li>
        <li>Preparing to TA Computer Science for Data Science (<a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~mwachs/data120-spr22/syllabus.html">old syllabus</a>)
        and Introduction to Bayesian Epistemology (<a href="https://philosophy.uchicago.edu/node/10130">course page</a> — I'm the first undergrad to TA for UChicago's Philosophy department)</li>
        <li>Making crossword puzzles</li>
        <li>Thinking about what to add to this site<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" />
          <span class="sidenote">
            Thoughts include:
            <ul>
              <li>a script to convert my markdown drafts into final html-able versions to put here. <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> does most of the work, but there are a few tweaks that'd be nice to automate.</li>
              <li>a way to convert my firefox bookmarks to a nice html list that i can host here. maybe something like <a href="https://home.hedy.dev/bookmarks/?">this</a>?</li>
              <li>a random button on the <a href="./404.html">404 page</a>. easy version would be a random page on this site, harder version would be a random article I've liked.</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="words">II. Writing</h2>
      Here's a quick look through a few public-facing things I've written. I haven't finished consolidating everything here, so feel free to <a href="#socials">reach out</a> and check if you're looking for a particular genre of writing that isn't below, there's a chance I have it anyway.
      <h3>Nonfiction</h3>

    <h2 id="crosswords">III. Crosswords</h2>
    <p>
      I make crossword puzzles! You can solve some of them in the <a href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?author=Henry+Josephson"><i>New York Times</i></a> and the <a href="https://chicagomaroon.com/staff_name/henry-josephson/"><i>Chicago Maroon</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll also publish puzzles <a href="./xw/index.html">on this page</a> — expect more once I've graduated and can no longer send non-NYT grids to the <i>Maroon</i>.  
    </p>

    <h2 id="socials">IV. Social Media & Contact Info</h2>

    <h2 id="feedback">V. Leave me anonymous feedback!</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that I ought to be the best version of myself that I can. I aspire
      to change my mind as I see new evidence, and it's very important to me that
      I balance the knowledge that I could be totally wrong with the push to 
      actually do the things I think are right.<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" />
      <span class="sidenote">
        I draw inspiration here from Joe Carlsmith's excellent piece <a href="https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/on-sincerity"><i>On Sincerity</i></a>.
      </span>
